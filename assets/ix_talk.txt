Hello,

Marko, from Dresden, studio intolight
part of the EMDL group, some research results now.

working in realtime, with a software called vvvv
the underlaying dome engine is open sourced.

great care was taken to allow easy meshing of virtual and physical spaces. 
staging of 3d objects and landscapes around the virtual dome helps to compose scenes. 

i will show five. the curtain will close between them to highlight there is a teleportation between scenes and aesthetics happening, but each one will focuson a different aspect of the the basic idea of moving the point of immersion. 

0. Straight Struts
==================
Who is seeing straight lines only?

From the Sweet Spot all Struts will appear straight, but nowhere else, because we project on a curved canvas.
sweet spot: at satosphere it is 3.8m in the middle of the dome.

I prefer to call it Point of Immersion, it is where the projection onto the architecture and the expected perspective properties of the virtual scene converge in the human eye. It is the point where the illusion is the most convincing.

Long story short, I made a vvvv setup where this point can be changed, for bonus points even in realtime.

1. Pano
==================
Tapestry closed.
Montreal Graffiti + Tapestry -- peek inside
4 panoramas

---walk left and right with wasd

Next step, a tracker. Candle.

-- walk left and right with a candle.


2. SpaceGrid, ColumsTrees
==================
depth by parallax: explanation. 

emdl is using a lot of slow camera movement paths, I am using slow candle movement paths.

grid and dust is hint for depth

CAVE reference.
Occulus reference?

Only one sweet spot. So what are the applications?

- more control for content creators about the visual experience
- gameplay
- guided tours


3. Gallery
==================
a dome is not a place to see stars anymore, it is a non-space that can serve as a room for a multitude of different socal spaces.

forums, theaters, a place to show travel visuals. in all these social interaction is restricted and sometimes even formalized, so the experience is good for a great majority of actors and audiences.

dome can be a place for a museum or public archive. 
browse through artworks, like neo browses through weapons

dust as depth reference.
lookat thingy

notice how pictures seem to be rectangular, even though they are projected on a curved wall.
if we could track the eye itself, it would be perfect.


4. data as landscape
====================
a place for decision making by exploring data in small groups. presentation of data as a walkable landscape.

abstract mock data, artistic approach

could be statistical data, live data
eg. song plays on soundcloud among total userbase
